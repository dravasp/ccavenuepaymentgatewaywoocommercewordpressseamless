[] Checking the status of payment transaction at CCAvenue Dashboard

## Testing and API Workflow
- Test using Postman API workflow and send encrypted payloads to CCAvenue.
  
[] Use Postman API Collection to Outline Error Troubleshooting with payload response `encrypted` and `decrypted` 
```
  - Explanation: `encrypted`
Key Generation: Ensure that the key used for encryption is kept secret and is 32 bytes long for AES-256.
Initialization Vector (IV): A random IV is generated for each encryption to ensure that the same plaintext will encrypt to different ciphertexts each time.
Encryption Process: The encrypt function takes the plaintext and the key, encrypts the data using AES-256-CBC, and returns the IV along with the encrypted data.
Sending Encrypted Data: You can then send the encryptedRequest to the payment gateway instead of the plain JSON request.
In Postman, you can use the pre-request script feature to run JavaScript code before sending the request.
You can include the encryption logic there to encrypt the request body dynamically.
Always handle encryption keys securely and avoid hardcoding them in your source code.
Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive information.
param `order_date` has been omitted for code integrity.

  - Explanation: `decrypted`
Decryption Function: The decrypt function uses the AES-256-CBC algorithm to decrypt the data. It splits the encrypted text into the IV and the encrypted data, then uses the IV to initialize the decipher.
Environment Variable: The encryption key is retrieved from an environment variable named encryption_key. Ensure that this key is a 32-byte string for AES-256 decryption.
Getting the Encrypted Response: The encrypted response body is obtained from the server response using pm.response.text().
Decrypting the Response: The encrypted response body is decrypted using the decrypt function. The decrypted data is logged to the console for verification.
Storing Decrypted Response: Optionally, the decrypted response can be stored in an environment variable named decrypted_response for further use in subsequent requests or tests.
